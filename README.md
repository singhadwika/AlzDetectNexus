# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a high-precision Alzheimer’s Disease deetction model developed using XGBoost, along with a Python Flask application to deploy the model. The application provides a user-friendly interface for predicting the likelihood of Alzheimer’s Disease based on patient data.

## Project Overview

- **Model:** XGBoost
- **Accuracy:** Achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.6%
- **Application:** Python Flask app for model deployment
- **Live Site:** [View Live Demo](https://alzheimer-disease-prediction.glitch.me/)

## Features

- **High-Precision Predictions:** Utilizes XGBoost for accurate disease prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a web-based interface for users to input patient data and receive predictions.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Glitch for easy access and use.
